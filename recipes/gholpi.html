    <h3>This humble Afghan stewed cauliflower dish is bold, spicy, and comforting. It’s befitting of a place on the sofreh for celebrations like Eid.</h3>
    <p>Gholpi is spicy stewed cauliflower often served as a vegetarian main dish along with warm bread. The cauliflower is spiced with advieh (a Persian spice blend), curry powder, turmeric, and a little tomato paste. It's so simple to make and cooks in about 25 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large sweet onion, roughly chopped (about 2 cups) </li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 Anaheim peppers, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 large cauliflower, cut into 2-inch florets</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a ghablama, wok, or large sauté pan set over medium-high heat, add the onions. Sauté them, without any oil for about 4 minutes, until they soften, keeping a lid on as much as possible to trap steam. It's okay if they brown around the edges. If they start charring, lower the heat and continue stirring. Stir in the oil and reduce the heat to medium. Continue to sauté for about 2 minutes, until the onions are tender and translucent.</li>

        <li>Cut off the stem and thinly slice 1 Anaheim pepper. Add the sliced peppers, tomato paste, curry powder, advieh, felfel, black pepper, and turmeric to the cooked onions. Sauté for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>

        <li>Stir in the cauliflower florets, 3/4 cup water, and salt. Cover with a lid and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you can easily pierce the florets with the tip of a paring knife. Taste the sauce and season with more salt, if needed.</li>
        <li>Set a small frying pan over medium-high heat. When it's hot, add the remaining 2 Anaheim peppers. Do not move them until they start to char, then turn them every 2 to 3 minutes to char them all over. This will create some peppery smoke, so open your windows!</li>
        <li>Transfer the gholpi onto a serving platter, being careful not to break or smash the florets. Set the charred peppers on top and serve warm with barbari or lavash.</li>
